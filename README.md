# ECE-466: Compilers - Spring 2021

This repository contains the work done throughout the semester.

To build all of the compiler so far run `make`. To build just the lexer run 'make lexer'. To build just the parser run 'make parser'. To build everything including quad generation run 'make quads'.

To run the lexer run `build/lexer`.

To run the parser up to quad generation run `build/parser`.

To run everything including quad generation run 'build/quads'.

Each component has an optional argument which represents the filename of a file in which the input will be read from. Otherwise input is read from stdin.
