# ECE-466: Compilers - Spring 2021

This repository contains the work done throughout the semester. To build any part of the compiler run `make`.

To run the lexer run `build/lexer`.

To run the parser run `build/parser`.

Each component has an optional argument which represents the filename of a file in which the input will be read from. Otherwise input is read from stdin.
